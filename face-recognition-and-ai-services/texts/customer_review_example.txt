I bought this bike in February of 2015. I put maybe sixty miles on it before all the Minnesota snow melted. I don't have a lot of money, so this was the purchase. Assembly was easy and any adjustments to it like on the brakes was easily made and what I didn't know I learned on YouTube. The grip ship plastic broke right away, but I was going to replace it anyway, which I did. I put a larger saddle on it, olong with a longer seat post since I'm 6'3". I put larger pedals on it as well. I did have to tighten the cranks on the bottom bracket. The bike plowed threw the snow with ease, and even though it's slow it's fun to ride and gives an incredible workout. I will also put longer cranks before this Winter, probably 172.5 mms. I will only be riding 7-10 miles a crack, and if this thing holds up I doubt I'll be upgrading to a whole new bike. I've also ridden it on gravel roads. Ultimately, I've liked the bike so far, but the miles ridden has been minimal, because I ride my road or mountain bike in non snowy seasons.
